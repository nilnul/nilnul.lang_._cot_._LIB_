# nilnul cot lang
(codename: `nilnul.lang_._cot_._LIB_`)

Formalize commented text, or `cot`, such as:
`abc(def(gh)`
where `(def(gh)` is regarded as comment, `abc` is regarded as the payload. The commented content `def(gh)` can be regarded also as `cot`. Also note the trailing `)` or beginning `(` is omittable.

`cot` is useful in naming file or folders. `nilnul.dev` uses `cot` in establishing a source files structure, and carries some automation such as automatically naming repos when running `nilnul.dev._bak_._WIN_` to push them up to the cloud.
